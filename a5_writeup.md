# Assignment 5 Write up

Assignment 5 can be broken up into the following parts:
1. Import the Necessary Modules:
- `copy`: For creating deep copies of objects
- `Stack` and `Queue`: Custom implementations for DFS and BFS operations
2. Utility Functions: 
- `remove_if_exists`: Removes a specified element from a list if it exists, which is used to remove the possibilites from a cell
3. Board Class:
- Represents the Sudoku board
- Consists of functions that will find the most constrained cell, and update the board, which eliminates possible solutions
4. DFS & BFS Functions:
- `DFS`: Uses depth-first search to solve the Sudoku puzzle. It works by trying to fill the most constrained cell with potential values until a solution is found or backtracks if a mistake is made
- `BFS`: Uses breadth-first search to solve the Sudoku puzzle in a similar fashion to DFS but explores nodes level by level
5. Main Execution:
- Defines two different sets of initial moves for Sudoku puzzles
- Uses both DFS and BFS to solve each puzzle and prints the results


After completing the assignment, answer the following reflection questions:

## Reflection Questions

1. How do the performance and efficiency of the Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms compare when solving Sudoku puzzles? In what scenarios might one approach be preferable over the other?

DFS is better for solving sudoku because it efficiently goes back when it hits a dead end, while saving memory. Although BFS is usefull for certain problems although it can be slower and use up a lot more memory for sudoku becuase it explores every single possible variant.

2. How did the choice of data structures (like the Stack for DFS and Queue for BFS) impact the implementation and functionality of the algorithms? Are there alternative data structures or design patterns that could have been used to achieve the same objectives?

 The stack for DFS and que for BFS impact how the certain algorithms explore a problem. The stack makes DFS explorer deeper first, while the que makes BFS find by levels. Alternative data structures like priority queues could be used. 



3. Considering the current implementation, how might the Sudoku solver be adapted or extended for larger puzzles or different types of grid-based logic games? How can the lessons learned from this assignment be applied to real-world problem-solving or optimization challenges?

To adapt the Sudoku solver for bigger problems or puzles I could adjust the algorithms to handle bigger grids. The lessons learned such as optimizing search algorithms and the ability to manage memorry usage, can be applied to real life problems like and possibly netowkr oruting.
